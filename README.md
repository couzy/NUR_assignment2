# NUR
NUR assignment

A project for the first assignment of Numerical recipes in Astrophysics.
In this we use numerical integration, differentiation, minimization, root-finding, sorting, interpolation and provide an RNG
At last we fit a model to the data of different halos and the amount of galaxies in those halo's.
